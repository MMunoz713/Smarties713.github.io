            <p>
                I have been building computers since 2014. I have always loved the hardware aspect of computers. Being able to take the parts of something and assemble them and have something post for the first time is like $1000 high stake Legos. I know about cudacores, processing cores, and hyper threading. But I didn't know anything about programming.
