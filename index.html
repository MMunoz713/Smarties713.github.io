                   Hey there! Welcome to my webpage!
                   I'm Martin.
                   I am a programming student at Northwestern University.
                   I am a partime streamer for Twitch.tv.
                   I plan to compete in TwitchCon's Rivals Tournament for a game called Apex Legends.
                   I am an avidI have been building computers since 2014.
                   I have always loved the hardware aspect of computers.
                   Being able to take the parts of something and assemble them and have something post for the first time is like $1000 high stake Legos.
                   I know about cudacores, processing cores, and hyper threading.
                   But I didn't know anything about programming.
                   I hope that with the next 6 months I will have the tools I need to be able to propell myself into a field that I enjoy working in.
                   I hope to one day be able to work for a company in the city or even something like tech maintainence for one of my favorite games in the future.
