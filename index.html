            <p>I am a full stack web developer. I recieved a full-stack web development certification from Northwestern
                University. I am a part time streamer on Twitch.tv. I enjoy exploring the city during the summer and
                reading books and watching movies during the winter.
            <br><br>
                My future plans are to attand TwitchCon in 2020 and to be able to get a job as a full-stack developer for 
                Twitch in the near future.
